# Avl
Avl Project in 2018 in C++

The project is about the AVL structure with functions insert,remove,left and right rotation and so on.
As input we get a txt file with some commands. These commands build the Avl (INSERT_NODE), remove node (DELETE_NODE) , read the existing Avl 
and write-save the existing avl.
